# pathogen_host_interaction_pipeline

Hello all! This is a project that I am currently doing for a research scholarship.

This is going to be a pipeline that allows users to input high content imaging of cells that are infected with specific pathogens. It will return results such as the % infected cells, and also gives information about protein recruitment.

This pipeline is based on the HRMAn pipeline in the article: **Defining hostâ€“pathogen interactions employing an artificial intelligence workflow**, obtainable at the link: https://elifesciences.org/articles/40560

I will continue adding updates to this pipeline!
